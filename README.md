# Propel3

Propel3 is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for modern PHP 7.1+.

# It is also written and maintained by people better and smarter than I am-- there wasn't an existing Propel3 on packagist. There is now...

So, this github repo and packagist entry exists solely for me to put into my PHP package.json, you are free to use it. But, know that once a valid propelorm/propel3 packagist package becomes available that I will begin using that and not maintaining this one.

Version 3 of Propel ORM replaces [Propel2](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2), which is not maintained anymore.
Propel3 introduces a data-mapper implementation which separates your entities from the actual persisting logic.

## Status

This is in current development and is not yet ready to use.

## Features

 - Propel is blazing fast
 - Data mapper with runtime UnitOfWork for high performance with massive object counts (bulks inserts/updates)
 - Query-Builder
 - Very IDE friendly thanks to code-generation
 - Generation of methods for all columns and relations
 - Database schema migration
 - Schema reverse engineering
 - Customizable
 - Propel comes with common ‘behaviors’
 - Completely unit tested for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite. Oracle and MSSQL are experimental.

## Example

### Define the entity

##### XML

```xml
<database name="default">
  <entity name="Vendor\Car">
      <field name="id" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true" type="INTEGER" />
      <field name="name" type="VARCHAR" required="true"  />
      <relation target="Publisher" onDelete="setnull"/>
      <relation target="Author" onDelete="setnull" onUpdate="cascade"/>
  </entity>
</database>
```

##### or annotations

In work.

```php

namespace Vendor

use Propel\Annotations\Entity;
use Propel\Annotations\Field;
use Propel\Annotations\PrimaryKey;

/**
 * @Entity()
 */ 
class Car
{
    /**
     * @PrimaryKey(auto_increment=true)
     */
    private $id;
    
    /**
     * @Field(type="VARCHAR")
     */
    private $name;
    
    // getters/setters
}
```

### Data mapper

```php
$propel = new Propel\Runtime\Configuration('path/to/propel.yml');

// require a session for each request/workload
$session = $propel->getSession();

$car = new Vendor\Car();
$car->setName('Ford');

$session->persist($car);
$session->commit();
```

### RAD/Active-record

```php
// use <entity name="Vendor\Car" activeRecord="true">
$car = new Vendor\Car();
$car->setName('Ford');
$car->save();
```

## Installation
